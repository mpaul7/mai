# DNS Attack Detection System

A machine learning-based system for detecting DNS-based attacks using anomaly detection techniques. The system processes DNS traffic data, aggregates it into time buckets, and uses an Isolation Forest algorithm to identify potential DNS attacks.

## Features

- DNS traffic flow analysis
- Time-based bucketing of network flows
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Comprehensive HTML report generation
- Support for both flat and bucketed data analysis
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance metrics visualization

## Project Structure    

- `data/`: Contains the raw DNS traffic data.
- `reports/`: Stores the generated HTML reports.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the DNS attack detection system.
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests for the system.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.
